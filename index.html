        <h1>Computer Networks</h1>
    <p> to Computer Networks! In this class, we explored how to take apart a computer and understand its components. This portfolio covers the topics we learned.</p>
    <h3>Computer components</h3>
     <ul>
      <li><h3>Case and form factors</h3></li>
      <p>"form factor" refers to the standardized size, shape, and physical specifications of hardware components like motherboards, cases, and power supplies, ensuring compatibility and interchangeability</p>
      <li><h3>Motherboard</h3></li>
      <p> The main circuit board that holds key components and allows other parts to connect and communicate. </p>
      <li><h3>BOI/UEFI</h3></li>
      <p>.Firmware that starts the computer, manages hardware, and helps the operating system communicate with it. </p>
      <li><h3>Memory</h3></li>
      <p>Stores data and instructions for quick access by the processor to keep the system running smoothly. </p>
      <li><h3>Processors</h3></li>
      <p>The central unit that carries out instructions and calculations, functioning as the "brain" of the computer.</p>
      <li><h3>Video and Expantion cards</h3></li>
      <p> Expansion cards improve a computer’s capabilities, with video cards specifically handling graphics. </p>
      <li><h3>Cooling</h3></li>
      <p>Helps prevent overheating by dissipating heat from computer components.</p>
      <li><h3>Power Suply</h3></li>
      <p> Converts electricity from the wall into a usable form for the computer’s components.</p>
    </ul>
     <h2>What is Networking?</h2>
   <p>Welcome to Computer Networking
    <p>Networking connects computers to share information and work together.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Components:</b> Things like routers and switches help connect devices.</li>
      <li><b>Addresses:</b> Computers use special addresses like IPs to talk to each other.</li>
      <li><b>Benefits:</b> Share files, use the internet, and connect devices easily.</li>
      <li><b>Types:</b> Examples include small networks (LAN) and big ones (WAN).</li>
    </ul>
